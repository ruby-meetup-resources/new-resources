  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>Running a meetup can be quite a lot of effort. We thought it would be great
  to make it easier for meetups to share resources which they've created, which could
  be used by other meetups. So far there are just a couple of resources, but we
  are hopeful this list will grow, especially with your support.</p>

  <p>Please tweet, mail your friends, and generally help get the word out there!</p>

  <h2>Contribution Guidelines</h2>
  <p>Ideally we are looking for <b>hack night / game resources</b>.  While we do have a <a href="./beginner_resources.html">list of beginner Ruby resources</a>,
  ideally we are looking for things which are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Ready to go.</b>.<br/>There shouldn't be too much configuration required to get the resource running.  Otherwise it's not making your life easier ;)</li>
    <li><b>Have a collaboration / team / game environment.</b>.<br/>There are lots of great resources out there for coding challeges etc (some listed on the
    beginner page), but what we're looking for is something "fun", like the robotwars, or a scoreboard for some sort of coding challenge type event.  Well, that's the ideal
    anyway, but sure it's all up for debate, and if you have something to contribute or a different idea, you can simply fork this middleman website and send
    us a pull request with your information in a markdown file.  <a href="https://github.com/ruby-meetup-resources/new-resources">Instructions available on the repo's README</a>
  </ol>
