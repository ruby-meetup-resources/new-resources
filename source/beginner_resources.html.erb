  <h3>Try Ruby</h3>
  <p><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/paths/ruby">Try Ruby</a>.  Written by codeschool, basic Ruby in the browser.  Even has some artwork from Why's Poignant guide..</p>

  <h3>Ruby Koans</h3>
  <p> <a href="http://rubykoans.com/">Ruby Koans</a> was written by Jim Weirich and Joe Oâ€™Brien, it's a great intro to Ruby, delivered TDD style</p>

  <h3>Codecademy Ruby Track</h3>

  <p><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby">The Ruby Track</a> More coding in-browser challenges</p>

  <h3>Ruby Warrior</h3>

  <p><a href="https://www.bloc.io/ruby-warrior/">Ruby Warrior</a>. A prettier version of Ryan Bates' ruby-warrior.  It doesn't have the scoreboard / code sharing version though like the
  ruby-meetup-resources one does.. Also, it suffers from the fact that you're not in your natural coding habitat.  That said, it's great fun!</p>

  <h3>Ruby Monk</h3>

  <p><a href="https://rubymonk.com/">Ruby Monk</a> Another interactive platform with a general intro to the language</p>
